# NetWatch

**NetWatch** is a network traffic analyzer tool designed to monitor and analyze network traffic in real-time. It captures packets traversing a network interface and provides insights into various aspects of network communication, including source and destination IP addresses, protocols, packet sizes, and more.

## How NetWatch Works

### Packet Capture

NetWatch uses packet sniffing techniques to capture network packets passing through a specified network interface. It listens for incoming and outgoing packets and extracts relevant information from each packet.

### Real-time Monitoring

As packets are captured, NetWatch analyzes them in real-time to provide immediate insights into network traffic patterns and behavior. It tracks metrics such as packet counts, protocol usage, traffic volume, and more.

### Protocol Analysis

NetWatch examines the protocols used in the captured packets, such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS, etc. It identifies the types of traffic flowing through the network and can help detect anomalies or suspicious activities.

### Traffic Visualization

NetWatch may include visualization features to graphically represent network traffic data. This could include charts, graphs, or diagrams showing trends, patterns, and relationships between different network entities.

### Packet Filtering and Analysis

NetWatch may allow users to filter captured packets based on specific criteria, such as source/destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, packet sizes, etc. It enables users to focus on relevant traffic and ignore noise.

### Alerting Mechanisms

NetWatch may include alerting mechanisms to notify users of unusual or potentially malicious network activities. Alerts can be triggered based on predefined rules, thresholds, or abnormal behavior detected in the network traffic.

### Logging and Reporting

NetWatch logs captured packets and analysis results for further investigation or reporting purposes. It provides a detailed record of network traffic, which can be useful for forensic analysis, troubleshooting, or compliance requirements.

Overall, NetWatch serves as a powerful tool for network administrators, security professionals, and researchers to gain insights into network behavior, detect security threats, troubleshoot network issues, and optimize network performance. It enhances network visibility and enables proactive monitoring and management of network infrastructure.
